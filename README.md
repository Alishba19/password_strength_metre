🔐 Password Strength Meter -
This is a small Python project that checks the security of any password. It tells us its strength (weak, moderate, strong) based on the length of the password, letters (upper/lower case), numbers, and special characters.✅

If the password is weak, it gives feedback and also generates and suggests a stronger password.✅
